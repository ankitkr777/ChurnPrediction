Churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, businesses can proactively address customer retention and improve long-term profitability.

This project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts customer churn based on features like demographics, engagement metrics, and service usage.
